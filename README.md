# Python-Game-List

literally just me trying to learn how git command line works while making a thing that probably isnt useful to 99% of people

To do:

- Game launching
    - the code to do this is there, it just needs testing, commented out for now
- Button stylization
    - the buttons are squished together for now
    - will need to use css to change position of buttons
- Pages to add, edit, and delete games
    - will update the json file
    - possibly add an undo change button
        - changes get cached (old json is kept until next change)
